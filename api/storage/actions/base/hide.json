{"id":"hide","name":"Hide","description":"You huddle behind cover or greater cover or deeper into \nconcealment to become hidden, rather than observed. The \nGM rolls your Stealth check in secret and compares the \nresult to the Perception DC of each creature you’re observed \nby but that you have cover or greater cover against or are \nconcealed from. You gain the circumstance bonus from cover \nor greater cover to your check.","type":"Base","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":null,"success":"If the creature could see you, you’re now hidden \nfrom it instead of observed. If you were hidden from or \nundetected by the creature, you retain that condition.\n If you successfully become hidden to a creature but \nthen cease to have cover or greater cover against it or be \nconcealed from it, you become observed again. You cease \nbeing hidden if you do anything except Hide, Sneak, or Step. \n If you attempt to Strike a creature, the creature remains flat\nfooted against that attack, and you then become observed. If \nyou do anything else, you become observed just before you \nact unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow \nyou to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without \nbeing noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.\n If a creature uses Seek to make you observed by it, you \nmust successfully Hide to become hidden from it again.","failure":null,"criticalFailure":null},"cost":1,"skill":null,"materials":null,"traits":["secret"],"trigger":null,"rules":null}
