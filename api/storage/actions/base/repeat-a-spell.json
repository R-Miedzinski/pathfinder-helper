{"id":"repeat-a-spell","name":"Repeat a Spell","description":"You repeatedly cast the same spell while moving at half speed. \nTypically, this spell is a cantrip that you want to have in effect \nin the event a combat breaks out, and it must be one you can \ncast in 2 actions or fewer. In order to prevent fatigue due \nto repeated casting, youâ€™ll likely use this activity only when \nsomething out of the ordinary occurs.\n You can instead use this activity to continue Sustaining a \nSpell or Activation with a sustained duration. Most such spells \nor item effects can be sustained for 10 minutes, though some \nspecify they can be sustained for a different duration.
