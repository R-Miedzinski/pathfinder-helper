{"id":"delay","name":"Delay","description":" You wait for the right moment to act. The rest of your turn doesn’t \nhappen yet. Instead, you’re removed from the initiative order. \nYou can return to the initiative order as a free action triggered by \nthe end of any other creature’s turn. This permanently changes \nyour initiative to the new position. You can’t use reactions until \nyou return to the initiative order. If you Delay an entire round \nwithout returning to the initiative order, the actions from the \nDelayed turn are lost, your initiative doesn’t change, and your \nnext turn occurs at your original position in the initiative order.\n When you Delay, any persistent damage or other negative \neffects that normally occur at the start or end of your turn occur \nimmediately when you use the Delay action. Any beneficial \neffects that would end at any point during your turn also end. \nThe GM might determine that other effects end when you \nDelay as well. Essentially, you can’t Delay to avoid negative \nconsequences that would happen on your turn or to extend \nbeneficial effects that would end on your turn.","type":"Encounter","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"criticalFailure":null},"cost":0,"skill":null,"materials":null,"traits":null,"trigger":"Your turn begins.","rules":null}
