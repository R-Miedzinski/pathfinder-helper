{"id":"steal","name":"Steal","description":"You try to take a small object from another creature without \nbeing noticed. Typically, you can Steal only an object of \nnegligible Bulk, and you automatically fail if the creature who \nhas the object is in combat or on guard.\n Attempt a Thievery check to determine if you successfully \nSteal the object. The DC to Steal is usually the Perception DC \nof the creature wearing the object. This assumes the object \nis worn but not closely guarded (like a loosely carried pouch \nf\n illed with coins, or an object within such a pouch). If the object \nis in a pocket or similarly protected, you take a –5 penalty to \nyour Thievery check. The GM might increase the DC of your \ncheck if the nature of the object makes it harder to steal (such\n as a very small item in a large pack, or a sheet of parchment \nmixed in with other documents).\n You might also need to compare your Thievery check result \nagainst the Perception DCs of observers other than the person \nwearing the object. The GM may increase the Perception DCs \nof these observers if they’re distracted.","type":"Base","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":null,"success":" You steal the item without the bearer noticing, or an \nobserver doesn’t see you take or attempt to take the item.","failure":"The item’s bearer notices your attempt before you can \ntake the object, or an observer sees you take or attempt \nto take the item.
