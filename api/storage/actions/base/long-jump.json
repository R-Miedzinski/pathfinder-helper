{"id":"long-jump","name":"Long Jump","description":" You Stride, then make a horizontal Leap and attempt an \nAthletics check to increase the length of your jump. The DC \nof the Athletics check is equal to the total distance in feet \nyou’re attempting to move during your Leap (so you’d need \nto succeed at a DC 20 check to Leap 20 feet). You can’t Leap \nfarther than your Speed.\n If you didn’t Stride at least 10 feet, or if you attempt to jump \nin a different direction than your Stride, you automatically fail \nyour check. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the \nsituation, as determined by the GM.","type":"Base","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":null,"success":"Increase the maximum horizontal distance you Leap \nto the desired distance.","failure":" You Leap normally.","criticalFailure":"You Leap normally, but then fall and land prone."},"cost":2,"materials":null,"traits":null,"trigger":null,"rules":null}
