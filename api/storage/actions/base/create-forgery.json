{"id":"create-forgery","name":"Create Forgery","description":" You create a forged document, usually over the course of a \nday or a week. You must have the proper writing material to \ncreate a forgery. When you Create a Forgery, the GM rolls a \nsecret DC 20 Society check. If you succeed, the forgery is of \ngood enough quality that passive observers can’t notice the \nfake. Only those who carefully examine the document and \nattempt a Perception or Society check against your Society \nDC can do so. \nIf the document’s handwriting doesn’t need to be specific \nto a person, you need only to have seen a similar document \nbefore, and you gain up to a +4 circumstance bonus to your \ncheck, as well as to your DC (the GM determines the bonus). \nTo forge a specific person’s handwriting, you need a sample of \nthat person’s handwriting.\n If your check result was below 20, the forgery has some \nobvious signs of being a fake, so the GM compares your \nresult to each passive observer’s Perception DC or Society DC, \nwhichever is higher, using the success or failure results below. \nOnce the GM rolls your check for a document, that same result \nis used against all passive observers’ DCs no matter how many \ncreatures passively observe that document. \nAn observer who was fooled on a passive glance can still \nchoose to closely scrutinize the documents on the lookout for \na forgery, using different techniques and analysis methods \nbeyond the surface elements you successfully forged with \nyour original check. In that case, the observer can attempt a \nPerception or Society check against your Society DC (if they \nsucceed, they know your document is a forgery).","type":"Skilled","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":null,"success":"The observer does not detect the forgery.","failure":"The observer knows your document is a forgery.","criticalFailure":null},"cost":null,"skill":"Society","materials":null,"traits":["downtime","secret"],"trigger":null,"rules":null}
