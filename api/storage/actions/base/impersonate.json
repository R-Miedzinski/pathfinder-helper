{"id":"impersonate","name":"Impersonate","description":" You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or \nsomething you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes \n10 minutes and requires a disguise kit (found on page 290), but \na simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying \nto imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion. \n In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your \ndeception only if they use the Seek action to attempt \nPerception checks against your Deception DC. If you attempt \nto directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM \nrolls a secret Deception check for you against that creature’s \nPerception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific \nindividual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a \ncircumstance bonus based on how well they know the person \nyou’re imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception \ncheck even if you aren’t directly interacting with others.","type":"Exploration","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":"","success":"You trick the creature into thinking you’re the person \nyou’re disguised as.
