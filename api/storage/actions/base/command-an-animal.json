{"id":"command-an-animal","name":"Command an Animal","description":" You issue an order to an animal. Attempt a Nature check \nagainst the animal’s Will DC. The GM might adjust the DC if the \nanimal has a good attitude toward you, you suggest a course of \naction it was predisposed toward, or you offer it a treat. \nYou automatically fail if the animal is hostile or unfriendly \nto you. If the animal is helpful to you, increase your degree of \n success by one step. You might be able to Command an Animal \nmore easily with a feat like Ride (page 266).\n Most animals know the Leap, Seek, Stand, Stride, and \nStrike basic actions. If an animal knows an activity, such as a \nhorse’s Gallop, you can Command the Animal to perform the \nactivity, but you must spend as many actions on Command \nan Animal as the activity’s number of actions. You can also \nspend multiple actions to Command the Animal to perform \nthat number of basic actions on its next turn; for instance, you \ncould spend 3 actions to Command an Animal to Stride three \ntimes or to Stride twice and then Strike.","type":"Base","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":null,"success":"The animal does as you command on its next turn.","failure":"The animal is hesitant or resistant, and it does nothing.","criticalFailure":"The animal misbehaves or misunderstands, \nand it takes some other action determined by the GM."},"cost":1,"skill":null,"materials":null,"traits":["auditory","concentrate"],"trigger":null,"rules":null}
