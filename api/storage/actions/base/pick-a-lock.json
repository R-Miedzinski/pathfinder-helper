Locks of higher qualities \nmight require multiple successes to unlock, since otherwise even \nan unskilled burglar could easily crack the lock by attempting \nthe check until they rolled a natural 20. If you lack the proper \ntools, the GM might let you used improvised picks, which are \ntreated as shoddy tools, depending on the specifics of the lock.
