{"id":"swim","name":"Swim","description":" You propel yourself through water. In most calm water, you \nsucceed at the action without needing to attempt a check. If \nyou must breathe air and you’re submerged in water, you must \nhold your breath each round. If you fail to hold your breath, you \nbegin to drown (as described on page 478). If the water you are \nswimming in is turbulent or otherwise dangerous, you might \nhave to attempt an Athletics check to Swim.\n If you end your turn in water and haven’t succeeded at a \nSwim action that turn, you sink 10 feet or get moved by the \ncurrent, as determined by the GM. However, if your last action \non your turn was to enter the water, you don’t sink or move \nwith the current that turn.","type":"Base","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":"You move through the water 10 feet, plus 5 feet \nper 20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 15 feet for most PCs).","success":"You move through the water 5 feet, plus 5 feet per \n20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 10 feet for most PCs).You move through the water 5 feet, plus 5 feet per \n20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 10 feet for most PCs).","failure":null,"criticalFailure":"You make no progress, and if you’re holding \nyour breath, you lose 1 round of air."},"cost":1,"materials":null,"traits":["move"],"trigger":null,"rules":null}
