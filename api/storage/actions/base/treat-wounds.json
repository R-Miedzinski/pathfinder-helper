{"id":"treat-wounds","name":"Treat Wounds","description":"You spend 10 minutes treating one injured living creature \n(targeting yourself, if you so choose). The target is then \ntemporarily immune to Treat Wounds actions for 1 hour, but \nthis interval overlaps with the time you spent treating (so a \npatient can be treated once per hour, not once per 70 minutes).\n The Medicine check DC is usually 15, though the GM might \nadjust it based on the circumstances, such as treating a patient \noutside in a storm, or treating magically cursed wounds. If you’re \nan expert in Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check \nto increase the Hit Points regained by 10; if you’re a master of \nMedicine, you can instead attempt a DC 30 check to increase \nthe Hit Points regained by 30; and if you’re legendary, you can \ninstead attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Hit Points regained \nby 50. The damage dealt on a critical failure remains the same.\n If you succeed at your check, you can continue treating the \ntarget to grant additional healing. If you treat them for a total \nof 1 hour, double the Hit Points they regain from Treat Wounds.\n The result of your Medicine check determines how many \nHit Points the target regains.","type":"Skilled","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":" The target regains 4d8 Hit Points, and its \nwounded condition is removed.
