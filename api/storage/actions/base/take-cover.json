If you would \nhave standard cover, you instead gain greater cover, which \nprovides a +4 circumstance bonus to AC; to Reflex saves \nagainst area effects; and to Stealth checks to Hide, Sneak, or \notherwise avoid detection. Otherwise, you gain the benefits of \nstandard cover (a +2 circumstance bonus instead). This lasts \nuntil you move from your current space, use an attack action, \nbecome unconscious, or end this effect as a free action.","type":"Encounter","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"criticalFailure":null},"cost":1,"skill":null,"materials":null,"traits":null,"trigger":null,"rules":"You are benefiting from cover, are near a feature \nthat allows you to take cover, or are prone."}
