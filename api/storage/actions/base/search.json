{"id":"search","name":"Search","description":" You Seek meticulously for hidden doors, concealed hazards, \nand so on. You can usually make an educated guess as to which \nlocations are best to check and move at half speed, but if you \nwant to be thorough and guarantee you checked everything, you \nneed to travel at a Speed of no more than 300 feet per minute, or \n150 feet per minute to ensure you check everything before you \nwalk into it. You can always move more slowly while Searching \nto cover the area more thoroughly, and the Expeditious Search \nfeat increases these maximum Speeds. If you come across a \nsecret door, item, or hazard while Searching, the GM will attempt \na free secret check to Seek to see if you notice the hidden object \nor hazard. In locations with many objects to search, you have to \nstop and spend significantly longer to search thoroughly","type":"Exploration","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"criticalFailure":null},"cost":null,"skill":null,"materials":null,"traits":["concentrate","exploration"],"trigger":null,"rules":null}
