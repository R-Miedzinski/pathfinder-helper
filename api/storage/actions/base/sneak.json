{"id":"sneak","name":"Sneak","description":" You can attempt to move to another place while becoming \nor staying undetected. Stride up to half your Speed. (You can \nuse Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming \ninstead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement \ntype; you must move at half that Speed.)\n If you’re undetected by a creature and it’s impossible for that \ncreature to observe you (for a typical creature, this includes \nwhen you’re invisible, the observer is blinded, or you’re in \ndarkness and the creature can’t see in darkness), for any critical \nfailure you roll on a check to Sneak, you get a failure instead. \nYou also continue to be undetected if you lose cover or greater \ncover against or are no longer concealed from such a creature.\n At the end of your movement, the GM rolls your Stealth \ncheck in secret and compares the result to the Perception \nDC of each creature you were hidden from or undetected by \nat the start of your movement. If you have cover or greater \ncover from the creature throughout your Stride, you gain the \n+2 circumstance bonus from cover (or +4 from greater cover) \nto your Stealth check. Because you’re moving, the bonus \nincrease from Taking Cover doesn’t apply. You don’t get to roll \nagainst a creature if, at the end of your movement, you neither \nare concealed from it nor have cover or greater cover against \nit. You automatically become observed by such a creature.","type":"Base","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":null,"success":" You’re undetected by the creature during your movement \nand remain undetected by the creature at the end of it.\n You become observed as soon as you do anything other \nthan Hide, Sneak, or Step. If you attempt to Strike a creature, \nthe creature remains flat-footed against that attack, and you \nthen become observed. If you do anything else, you become \nobserved just before you act unless the GM determines \notherwise. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly \nunobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring \nanother Stealth check. If you speak or make a deliberate \nloud noise, you become hidden instead of undetected.\n If a creature uses Seek and you become hidden to it as a \nresult, you must Sneak if you want to become undetected \nby that creature again.","failure":" A telltale sound or other sign gives your position away, \nthough you still remain unseen.
