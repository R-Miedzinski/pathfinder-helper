{"id":"lie","name":"Lie","description":" You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at \nleast 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single \nDeception check and compare it against the Perception DC of \nevery creature you are trying to fool. The GM might give them \na circumstance bonus based on the situation and the nature of \nthe lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable \nlies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler \nand more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it’s \nimpossible to get anyone to believe them.\n At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your \nlie, it might attempt a Perception check later to Sense Motive \nagainst your Deception DC to realize it’s a lie. This usually \nhappens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter \nyour statements.
