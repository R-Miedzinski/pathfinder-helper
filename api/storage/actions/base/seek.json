{"id":"seek","name":"Seek","description":" You scan an area for signs of creatures or objects. If you’re \nlooking for creatures, choose an area you’re scanning. If \nprecision is necessary, the GM can have you select a 30-foot \ncone or a 15-foot burst within line of sight. You might take a \npenalty if you choose an area that’s far away.\n If you’re using Seek to search for objects (including secret \ndoors and hazards), you search up to a 10-foot square adjacent \nto you. The GM might determine you need to Seek as an \nactivity, taking more actions or even minutes or hours if you’re \nsearching a particularly cluttered area.\n The GM attempts a single secret Perception check for you \nand compares the result to the Stealth DCs of any undetected \nor hidden creatures in the area or the DC to detect each \nobject in the area (as determined by the GM or by someone \nConcealing the Object). A creature you detect might remain \nhidden, rather than becoming observed, if you’re using an \nimprecise sense or if an effect (such as invisibility) prevents \nthe subject from being observed.","type":"Encounter","source":"basic","effects":{"criticalSuccess":"If you were searching for creatures, any \nundetected or hidden creature you critically succeeded \nagainst becomes observed by you.
